## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement

PaymentPredictor is a SaaS platform designed to help freelancers predict, prevent, and manage late payments from clients. By analyzing client payment patterns, industry data, and historical behavior, PaymentPredictor provides risk scores before freelancers accept projects and automates the follow-up process for outstanding invoices.

### The Opportunity

The freelance economy has exploded over the past decade. With over 70 million freelancers in the United States alone, and billions more worldwide, the gig economy represents one of the fastest-growing segments of the global workforce. However, this growth has come with a persistent, painful problem: late payments.

Research indicates that **85% of freelancers experience late payments**, with **63% waiting more than 30 days** past due dates to receive compensation for completed work. This creates cascading problems:

- Cash flow instability
- Difficulty planning for expenses
- Emotional stress and anxiety
- Time wasted on payment chasing
- Strained client relationships

PaymentPredictor addresses this problem head-on by providing:

1. **Predictive Risk Scoring** — Know which clients are likely to pay late before you accept the project
2. **Automated Follow-up Sequences** — Remove the awkwardness of payment chasing with professionally-crafted, automatically-sent reminders
3. **Cash Flow Forecasting** — See when money is actually likely to arrive, not just when it's due
4. **Client Payment Intelligence** — Build a database of client payment behavior over time

### Business Model

PaymentPredictor operates on a freemium SaaS model:

- **Free Tier:** 3 clients, basic reminders
- **Pro Tier ($19/month):** Unlimited clients, predictions, automation
- **Business Tier ($39/month):** Team features, advanced analytics, API access
